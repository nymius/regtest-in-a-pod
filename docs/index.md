# A Full Regtest Setup Available on Command

This project is useful for software developers who need a simple and powerful regtest setup ready to go at will. Once powered up, the podman container offers you an Electrum server to connect to, a block explorer, a compact block filter enabled node, and awesome aliases to get stuff done:

```shell
just sendto <address>

just mine 21

just bitcoindlogs

just esploralogs
```
