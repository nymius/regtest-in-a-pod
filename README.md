This repo is a companion to the [Using Podman Containers for Regtest Bitcoin Development](https://thunderbiscuit.com/posts/podman-bitcoin/) blog article.

It allows you to create a robust regtest environment which you can turn on and off at will using Podman. The final environment includes a lot of useful tools, namely:
1. A bitcoin core node and daemon
2. bitcoin-cli enabled
3. An Electrum server
4. An Esplora server
5. A block explorer
6. Useful aliases for working with the daemon from your command line
